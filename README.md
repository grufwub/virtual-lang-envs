# How To Use

Copy all of the bash scripts in this folder to /etc/setup.d/ (you will need to create this folder too)

The scripts in this folder will install the various language environments to /home/.envs

All be added to your shell environment by 'source /home/.envs/profile'

# Todos

- Fine-tune correct permissions of these files (could probably be locked down further)

- Bug-test! None found so far

- Edit go-script to allow multiple versions installed?
